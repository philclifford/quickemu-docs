## GUI (quickgui)

While `quickemu` and `quickget` are designed for the terminal, a
graphical user interface is also available:

- **[Quickgui](https://github.com/quickgui/quickgui)** by [Mark Johnson](https://github.com/marxjohnson) and [Yannick Mauray](https://github.com/ymauray).

To install Quickgui on Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannick-mauray/quickgui
sudo apt update
sudo apt install quickgui
```

Many thanks to [Luke Wesley-Holley](https://github.com/Lukewh) and
[Philipp Kiemle](https://github.com/daPhipz) for creating the
**[Quickemu icons](https://github.com/Lukewh/quickemu-icons)** ðŸŽ¨

## TUI (qqx)

From Nov 2023, there is also a multi option desktop integrated text
interface, the **quickemu quickget X terminal project**, a.k.a. **qqX**,
with lots of unique tools and utilities to help you make
light work of installations, snapshots and disk management

- **[qqX](https://github.com/TuxVinyards/qqX)** is independently curated
    by [Alex Genovese](https://github.com/TuxVinyards) (see the github pages)
