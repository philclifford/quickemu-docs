## Help, my Virtual Machine won't work

This is often due to something that has been missed out in installation of the basic dependencies.  

Download and try a different machine, a different distro .... Does that work?

Is it the specific distro that won't work? Or is it the whole of your Setup?

Make sure that your system & all your underlying Quickemu dependencies are up-to-date.

Also check your Host OS repository for different Qemu and Quickemu variants eg. base, full and desktop etc

Be also aware that new-user/walled garden distros, plus those offering Long Term Support, may not always have the latest versions.
